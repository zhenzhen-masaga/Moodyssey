            <p>Moodyssey was born from the minds of five passionate fourth-year computer engineering students at Polytechnic University of the Philippines, Manila - Computer Engineering Department. As part of our Elective 3 course, focused on web application development, we embarked on a journey to create a tool that empowers individuals to navigate the ever-changing landscape of their emotions.</p>

            <h3>OUR TEAM, <span className='text-red-500'>OUR VISION</span></h3>
            <p>We envision a world where everyone feels empowered to understand and nurture their inner selves, leading to a more connected and resilient society. A world where everyone has the tools and knowledge to navigate their inner world with confidence, build resilience, and cultivate inner peace. We believe that by fostering self-awareness and understanding, we can create a ripple effect of compassion and connection, one emotion at a time. Join us on this journey of self-discovery, where every click is a step towards emotional clarity and every scroll a whisper of your inner wisdom. We are here to guide you, to illuminate your path, and to remind you that you are not alone in the dance of your emotions.</p>
